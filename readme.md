### Strategy

#### Project overview

Welcome to my reinvented verrsion of the simon memory game. This main target demographic would be younger individuals, childrens and teens who would like to have a bit of a challenge and enhance their memory skills. The game is fun, intuitive, user friendly and fully responsive.

### Scope

Planning of my project was made using **Epics** at the highest level and then **User stories** as sub issues to the epic. Using User Stories we were able to place ourselves in the shoes of our end users so we can better plan our project. You can find the project board view and the backlog [HERE](https://github.com/users/JamesBracken/projects/18/views/1).

#### Agile methodology

This project followed an agile methodology approach to ensure we have an MVP by the project deadline and remained within scope. The project was developed in an iterative manner, being developed one component at a time. By using the Agile methodology we were able to get our MVP and more, we completed all Must and Should have user stories at present and can potentially still implement could have user stories.

**Moscow prioritisation**

To aid in getting to an MVP and remaining in project scope we used the moscow method. We organised our user stories by how important it would be to reaching an MVP, we listed them as **Must, Should, Could and Wont**. By organising each user story with a factor of importance, we were better able to direct our resources towards the most important components of the project labelled Must. Any user story labelled Should and Could was focues on later in the project only if within scope.

### Skeleton

**Wireframes**

A low-medium fidelity wireframe was made with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). There is a representation for the game at each major breakpoint of 320px, 576px, 768px and 992px. By creating wireframes we were able to better plan the needed user stories and ease development as we know exactly what we want. There are some components which do not exactly match the final product, some components might look slightly different due to scope or changes of plan.

### Surface

#### Colour scheme

The colour scheme of our final product is a representation of the original simon game. We used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ffffff-e0e000-00b800-00007a-cc0000-343635-000000) to create our color palette and used shades of these colors for game UI effects.

As there is already many colors in the game circles I decided to go with a simple background theme. I decided to use an Onyx background theme to aid users in being able to focus on the indicated circles.

#### Typography

We used [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to add the chosen fonts for 
our website. The fonts we used are a throwback to arcade themes which had very simillar kinds of simplistic old fashion games.

**Headings** - We used Press Start 2P for our headings to stand out as it has a higher font weight than most fonts and gives that arcade style look that we are going for.

**Body text** - We used IBM Plex Mono as it is a simple font and complements the headers that we have chosen.
